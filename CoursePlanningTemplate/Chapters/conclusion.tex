\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
So a 3d model that converts the radiation measurements into either mSv or Gy to a volume (sphere) with 1 kg of material as a function of the additional shielding mass with density rho, and shielding of y $\frac{grams}{cm^2}$ would highly improve the accuracy of the estimate. 

\noindent The data is available as appears from the figures, but I can not find such a model (I understand the actual radiation is time dependent but even an average or instance of the data would significantly increase estimate accuracy.)

\noindent Do you know any such models?
