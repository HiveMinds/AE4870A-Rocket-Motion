\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Hi, this is the interpretation of the notes I took of the clinic with Joost of physiotherapy TIM in Delft, Tuesday 01-05-2018. If you spot any mistakes, or would like to add something/make it more complete, please let me know and/or contact me for the edit link.

3 topics were discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neck
    \item Back
    \item Mobility/stretching*
\end{enumerate}

*I am unsure about the 3rd topic, not unsure about the content of that part though.
