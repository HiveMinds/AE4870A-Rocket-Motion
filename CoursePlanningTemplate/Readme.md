## Prerequisites

Have installed TexWorks, or Texmake and MikTex

## How to use

Create the pdf of your planning(=compile) by: running/double clicking the `buildme.vbs` file.

That will automatically build the pdf and generate a list of taskwarrior commands that allow you to instantly enter all the tasks of this planning into your agenda.

## TODO

Fix `CommandScripts.vbs` so that users don't have to use python.
