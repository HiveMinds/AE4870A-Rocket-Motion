## Configuring Texmaker for convenience ##
Normally you can switch between your tabs/files with `Alt+PageDown` and `Alt+PageUp`. However if you also have FLux installed on windows, those shortcuts are already mapped to reducing the blue content in your screen. The shortcuts wont work in that case. To switch between screens fast with your keyboard:

  7. Click Options.
  
  8. Click Configure Texmaker.

  9. Click tab: "Shortcuts" and scroll down to Action: "Next Documents".
  
  10. Click the "shortcut" next to `Next Document` and Press the shortcut you want, e.g. press `Ctrl+PageDown`.

  11. Then do the same for the `Previous Document`
