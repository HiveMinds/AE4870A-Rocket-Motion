# How to use
0. You can git clone this repository
1. You can edit and compile the pdf's in this repository with TexMaker (OpenSource):https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html
2. And then send a pull request after you have pushed your changes. After inspection of your pull request (and acceptance), you will be made collaborator in the private repo, to re-do your pull request which will be accepted. This will grant you access to all the exam solutions generated collectively! 

To change (a copy of) this a latex exam solution template after you have installed TexMaker:
  0. Open Main.tex file in TexMaker:

## Configuring Texmaker for convenience ##
Normally you can switch between your tabs/files with `Alt+PageDown` and `Alt+PageUp`. However if you also have FLux installed on windows, those shortcuts are already mapped to reducing the blue content in your screen. The shortcuts wont work in that case. To switch between screens fast with your keyboard:

  7. Click Options.
  
  8. Click Configure Texmaker.
  
  ![1](./HowToUseTexMaker/5.png)

  9. Click tab: "Shortcuts" and scroll down to Action: "Next Documents".
  
  10. Click the "shortcut" next to `Next Document` and Press the shortcut you want, e.g. press `Ctrl+PageDown`.
  
  ![1](./HowToUseTexMaker/6.png)
  
  11. Then do the same for the `Previous Document`
